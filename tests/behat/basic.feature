Feature: Embedded discussion filter
  In order to host conversations alongside content
  As a teacher
  I should be able to embed discussion threads inside Book chapters

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | One      |
      | student1 | Student   | One      |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course | name      | idnumber |
      | book     | C1     | Discuss A | book1    |
    And the following "mod_book > chapters" exist:
      | book      | title     | content | contentformat |
      | Discuss A | Chapter 1 | <p>Chapter text.</p><div class="embeddiscussion-embed" data-embeddiscussion="0123456789abcde1"></div> | 1 |
    And the following "local_embeddiscussion > threads" exist:
      | activity | embedkey         |
      | book1    | 0123456789abcde1 |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Plugin appears in the additional plugins list
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I navigate to "Plugins > Plugins overview" in site administration
    And I follow "Additional plugins"
    Then I should see "Embedded discussion"
    And I should see "local_embeddiscussion"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Filter renders the placeholder and the JS hydrates the discussion thread
    Given I log in as "student1"
    And I am on the "Discuss A" "book activity" page
    Then "[data-region='filter-embeddiscussion'][data-threadid]" "css_element" should exist
    And "[data-region='embeddisc-root'][data-anonymous='0']" "css_element" should exist
